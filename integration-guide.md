# 3-Step Integration Guide: Add Score Propagation

## Step 1: Add the Mixin (Copy-Paste)

At the top of your `enhanced_smart_java_extractor.py`:

```python
from collections import deque

class ScorePropagationMixin:
    """Drop-in score propagation for existing extractors"""
    
    def propagate_scores_to_callees(
        self,
        all_methods: Dict[str, 'EnhancedMethodInfo'],
        seed_method_sigs: Set[str],
        propagation_factor: float = 0.75,
        max_depth: int = 2
    ) -> Dict[str, int]:
        """
        BFS propagation: high-scoring methods boost their callees
        
        Returns: Dict[method_signature -> propagated_score]
        """
        propagated_scores = {}
        
        # Initialize seeds with intrinsic scores
        for sig in seed_method_sigs:
            if sig in all_methods:
                method = all_methods[sig]
                score = self._calculate_intrinsic_score(method)
                propagated_scores[sig] = score
        
        # BFS to propagate
        queue = deque([(sig, 0) for sig in seed_method_sigs])
        visited = set(seed_method_sigs)
        
        while queue:
            current_sig, depth = queue.popleft()
            
            if depth >= max_depth:
                continue
            
            current_method = all_methods.get(current_sig)
            if not current_method:
                continue
            
            current_score = propagated_scores.get(current_sig, 0)
            propagated = int(current_score * (propagation_factor ** (depth + 1)))
            
            # Propagate to callees
            for called_name in current_method.calls_made:
                for callee_sig, callee_method in all_methods.items():
                    if callee_method.method_name == called_name:
                        existing = propagated_scores.get(callee_sig, 0)
                        new_score = max(existing, propagated)
                        
                        if new_score > existing:
                            propagated_scores[callee_sig] = new_score
                            
                            if callee_sig not in visited:
                                visited.add(callee_sig)
                                queue.append((callee_sig, depth + 1))
        
        return propagated_scores
    
    def _calculate_intrinsic_score(self, method) -> int:
        """Calculate method's own score - ADAPT TO YOUR LOGIC"""
        score = 0
        
        if method.contains_keywords:
            score += 10
        
        if hasattr(method, 'relevance_score') and method.relevance_score:
            score += method.relevance_score.total_score
        
        if hasattr(method, 'mapping_annotations'):
            score += len(method.mapping_annotations) * 8
        
        if hasattr(method, 'field_mappings'):
            score += len(method.field_mappings) * 12
        
        return score
```

## Step 2: Inherit the Mixin

Change your class declaration:

```python
# BEFORE
class SmartJavaExtractor:
    def __init__(self):
        # ...

# AFTER
class SmartJavaExtractor(ScorePropagationMixin):  # ← Add this
    def __init__(self):
        # ... (no other changes needed)
```

---

## Step 3: Use Propagation in Your Main Method

In your `smart_extract_java_code_blocks` method, find where you filter relevant methods and replace it:

```python
# BEFORE (your existing code):
relevant_methods = set(seed_methods)

if include_callees:
    for depth in range(1, max_depth + 1):
        new_methods = set()
        for method_sig in list(relevant_methods):
            # ... add callees ...
        relevant_methods.update(new_methods)


# AFTER (with propagation):
relevant_methods = set(seed_methods)

if include_callees:
    print(f"\n[INFO] Propagating scores to callees...")
    
    # NEW: Get propagated scores
    propagated_scores = self.propagate_scores_to_callees(
        all_methods=all_methods,
        seed_method_sigs=seed_methods,
        propagation_factor=0.75,  # Tune this (0.6-0.9)
        max_depth=max_depth
    )
    
    # Include methods with sufficient score
    for method_sig, score in propagated_scores.items():
        if score >= 8:  # Tune this threshold
            relevant_methods.add(method_sig)
    
    print(f"[INFO] After propagation: {len(relevant_methods)} methods "
          f"(+{len(relevant_methods) - len(seed_methods)} from callees)")
```

---

## That's It! 

### Test It

```python
extractor = SmartJavaExtractor()

results = extractor.smart_extract_java_code_blocks(
    src_dir="/path/to/src",
    keywords=["postalCode"],
    mapping_file_path="/path/to/mapping.xlsx",
    max_depth=2,
    include_callees=True  # Must be True for propagation
)

# Check the results
for file, snippets in results.items():
    for snippet in snippets:
        if "validatePostalCode" in snippet:
            print("✓ Found callee that would have been missed!")
```

---

## Configuration Tips

### Propagation Factor (0.6 - 0.9)

```python
# Conservative (only very close callees)
propagation_factor=0.6  # Callees get 60% of parent score

# Balanced (recommended)
propagation_factor=0.75  # Callees get 75% of parent score

# Aggressive (include more callees)
propagation_factor=0.85  # Callees get 85% of parent score
```

### Score Threshold (5 - 15)

```python
# Include many callees (might get noise)
if score >= 5:  
    relevant_methods.add(method_sig)

# Balanced (recommended)
if score >= 8:
    relevant_methods.add(method_sig)

# Only high-confidence callees
if score >= 12:
    relevant_methods.add(method_sig)
```

### Max Depth (1 - 3)

```python
max_depth=1  # Only direct callees
max_depth=2  # Direct + nested callees (recommended)
max_depth=3  # Very deep nesting (might be too much)
```

## Example Output Improvement

### Before Propagation:
```
[INFO] Found 5 seed methods
[INFO] Depth 1: Added 3 methods
[INFO] Extraction completed: 8 methods

Missing: validatePostalCode, normalizeZipCode (scores too low)
```

### After Propagation:
```
[INFO] Found 5 seed methods
[INFO] Propagating scores to callees...
[PROPAGATION] validatePostalCode gets +18 from mapPostalCode (depth 1)
[PROPAGATION] normalizeZipCode gets +18 from mapPostalCode (depth 1)
[PROPAGATION] formatZipCode gets +13 from normalizeZipCode (depth 2)
[INFO] After propagation: 13 methods (+8 from callees)
[INFO] Extraction completed: 13 methods

✓ All critical methods included!
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No new methods added by propagation"

**Cause**: Propagation factor or threshold too restrictive

**Fix**: 
```python
# Increase propagation factor
propagation_factor=0.85  # Was 0.75

# Lower threshold
if score >= 5:  # Was 8
```

### "Too many irrelevant methods included"

**Cause**: Propagation too aggressive

**Fix**:
```python
# Decrease propagation factor
propagation_factor=0.65  # Was 0.75

# Raise threshold
if score >= 12:  # Was 8

# Reduce max depth
max_depth=1  # Was 2
```

### "Propagation not running"

**Check**:
```python
# Must have include_callees=True
results = extractor.smart_extract_java_code_blocks(
    ...,
    include_callees=True  # ← Must be True!
)
```

## Benefits You Get

✅ **Callees no longer excluded** due to low intrinsic scores  
✅ **Minimal code changes** (~30 lines added)  
✅ **No breaking changes** to existing logic  
✅ **Configurable** via 3 simple parameters  
✅ **Clear logging** shows what's being propagated  

**Result**: Complete method chains without missing critical callees!
